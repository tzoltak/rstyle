\strong{\code{sequence} other than "simultaneous"}

For number of responses between 5 and 6 function generates scoring
matrix in a way mimicking BÃ¶ckenholt's approach (2017) to describe
response to the item as a sequence of binary decissions involving choosing
of the middle, extreme and acquiescence categories - this decisions may be
made in diferent order, what is controlled by parameter \code{sequence}.

With less than 5 possible responses functions apply the same logic, but not
all of the three aformentioned styles can be invloved because lack of
variablity in possible responses.

With more than 6 possible responses there must be odditional trait added to
scoringMatrix to describe process of choice between all the possible
responses. In such a case function adds 4th column to a scoring matrix that
is named \emph{i} (standing for intensity) and is filled up with scores for
such rows of a scoring matrix that occurs more than once. Scores in this
column are sequences of positive integers either increasing
(\code{reversed=FALSE}) or decreasing (\code{reversed=TRUE}) that are
generted either as a one sequence for all the rows to be filled up
(\code{iType="between"}) or as independent sequences for each unique
combination of values in the precious columns (\code{iType="within"}).)

\strong{\code{sequence} is "simultaneous"}

In this case a GPCM scoring matrix is generated mimicking approach of
Plieninger (2016), i.e. assuming that response process is
a \emph{simultaneous} and four factors: intensity of the trait that
is \strong{not} a response style (column \emph{i}), tendency to choose middle
\emph{categories} (column \emph{m}) tendency to choose extreme
\emph{categories} (column \emph{e}) and tendency to choose cquiescence
\emph{categories} (column \emph{a}) contribute alltogether to propensity
of choosing each response.
