# To do

-   test!

-   function to be provided as a `scoringOnPreviousResponses` parameter to `make_item()`;

    -   this will allow to model careless/inattentive response style;
    -   must check how burdensome is dealing with patterns of all the prevoius responses - it is possible that for efficiency reasons we should restrict the length of trace that is used;

-   function(s) that will automate creating sets of items (i.e. *tests*) providing user a control of the distribution of values of its parameters;

-   function(s) to compute non-GPCM (2PLM) models at nodes of *sequentiialy*Â responsed items;
