# How to use package

# How package works

# To do

-   some documentation on how to use package;

-   function(s) that will automate creating sets of items (i.e. *tests*) providing user a control of the distribution of values of its parameters;

-   functions to compute non-GPCM (2PLM) models at nodes of *sequentially*Â responded items;

-   functions to use as `editResponse` argument to `make_item()`;

-   implementation of Plieninger & Heck (2018) generalized IRTree approach;

    -   in this approach responding is assumed to be *sequential* but be *locally simultaneous* () at some nodes;

    -   refactorization will be needed because such generalized approach can't be described with a single scoring matrix (at least not without additional information about grouping of columns) - rather actual trees should be implemented to describe items' structure;
