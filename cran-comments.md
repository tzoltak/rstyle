# Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Added references to the documents describing the methods that are used in the package in the DESCRIPTION file.

- Added missing \value to log-normal.Rd.

- Removed `rm(list = ls())` usage from tests.

# NOTES

There is 1 NOTE:

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
     ARS (25:16)
     ERS (24:71)
     IRTree (20:72)
     PCM (21:21)

These are acronyms that are OK.
